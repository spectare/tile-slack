Font Tools:
If you would like to get yourself a decent font editor to create your own font(s), I recommend Fontographer, although TypeTool might do the job, too.  FontLab is the flagship typographic tool of the Fontlab company.

Another free online font creation tool, the FontStructor, is available through:

Apple iOS seems to have some promising font creation tools available, unfortunately I can't test anything since I have the original iPad which has been completely abandoned as a tablet platform (we reset and now it is worthless, it can't run a single thing securely).

At a couple of different times there were font creation apps on Android OS, but the fonts generated never worked outside of the application. There have been a lot of pretenders labeled as font creators, but they are just font downloaders.


Submit Your Font:
Be sure to submit any font you might create or legally modify that we could use here. Any font that has a complete letterset (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 &+~!@#$%^&*()_=-`"':;<>?/|\[{}],.) that is freely distributable would be greatly apprectiated, especially if it is OK for commercial use.  We also love fonts that can be used as web fonts.  Be sure to use a unicode letterset when you save your work or the font simply won't display right here at Font-Journal.  It's our most important requirement.


About Font-Journal:
Font-Journal is a cataloged archive of freeware and shareware fonts that I maintain for my small business, start-up and freelancing clients.  I try to collect PC truetype freeware fonts that can be used for commercial purposes, and shareware fonts that can be used for commercial purposes upon registration and/or payment of the shareware fee.  I also try to collect freely distributable web fonts of the same variety.  The end result is a pretty decent font repository, although I can only work on it in my spare time, which I have little of.

About Me:
My portfolio usually needs to be updated, as I always have a ton of projects going and I even like to design my own fonts to offer exclusively through my font respository at Font-Journal.  But it is another good way to contact me.

I started out as an motorcycle racer and mechanic.  That didn't work out and I never got in a race car as planned.  I wound-up as an illustrator, animator, doing some programming and tech support.  Plus I have always been amatuer artist, photographer and videographer.  I was designing logos, posters and graphics in college with Illustrator and Photoshop, and wound-up making a website portfolio just afterwards.  A few people liked it and I wound-up as a freelance web design studio.  Then I expanded into web hosting, then domain name registrations and servers, offering a complete set of webmaster tools as Domain Hostmaster.  I then added the Domainance store in an effort to keep .name registrations and transfers available when our vendor dropped it.  Site Domains has been added to ensure the best deals between all 3 registrars.

Nowadays, I am just trying to corner a peice of the domain name registration and website hosting space, offering more for less than most with better customer/technical support.  Professional domainers, designers, developers, optimizers and webmasters do like how I keep prices as low as possible and that I add my expertise and value where I can.  In my spare time I have other projects, such as designing my own fonts.
